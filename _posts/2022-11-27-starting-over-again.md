ive pulled the trigger and have started working on my new landing page portfolio

i decided to just start by following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urgi2iz9P6U), its a single page webapp so should be pretty *doable*

it uses:
- next js
- tailwindcss
- sanity.io (cms thing looks pretty dopeeee)
- vercel for deployment (i could probably use netlify maybe but ill stick to the tutorial and check out vercel as well)

hopefully this works out, it built and everything so im hoping i actually finish it

also excited to check out using a cms system to handle backend stuff, even tho i kind of started getting used to this .md stuff for posting
