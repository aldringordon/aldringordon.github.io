its taking way longer than i thought, having to write sizing rules for the different screen sizes for each tag in each component is getting pretty repetitive

tailwindcss is pretty good in that you can just write all the stuff you need in the className, but fucking hell the lines get long:

the animation that you get to use is pretty cool tho, i can see how people make cool front ends with it but its **a bit extra**
