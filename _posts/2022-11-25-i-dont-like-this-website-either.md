idk why but last night as  I was creating the about page i was trying to customise the page more than i should

its a bit weird, for posts i dont want any customisation, i just want to write the stupid text file and be done with it

but it was like a static about page, and i wanted to do more with it

so my options are to either:
- figure out how to just replace it with a custom page (just style a html thingy and hope it works out)
- use a new framework
- actually just build one from scratch (which i really want to do)

im heavily leaning towards just making one from scratch but ill leave this one here **for now**...
