## Initial device testing

so i deployed the website on vercel took literally 5 minutes: https://aldringordon.vercel.app

when i opened it up on my phone i got a nice surprise flicking through the pages

i documented the issues and tagged them with a *mobile* label

i think that a lot of these issues can be fixed by resizing the xs screen tailwind css settings

i think it will be a good idea to run an android emulator as well whilst coding and have the website open on it at the same time

now that i think about it i **should** be doing that and checking how the site looks in landscape mode

i think during the week ill just work on squashing out maybe 1-2 bugs, i dont want to go full developer mode on it after work i should be taking a break, but i do want to chip away at it as much as i can so it can be complete

also think that maintaining this site frequently with the current workflow will help with retention on all this shitty web dev stuff
