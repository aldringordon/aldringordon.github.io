fridays are supposed to be my one day of the week where i get to kinda fuck work off and do some career development stuff.

before i was doing a pluralsight course which was just creating a basic website using Java and Angular (obviously im new to all this)

today i decided to try add some functionality to a devops automation tool that we use internally at the bank

setting up the server and client on my local env literally took me all day, i was just sitting around waiting for packages to install and code to build and then bugfixing when the setup crashed

there was so much waiting around that i decided to work on **THIS** site in between

**tldr;** i spent my whole day waiting around for projects to build and didnt get to build anything

yay
