## heres another progress update

so as ive been working on the site the things i dont like ive been issue tracking in github

i never thought id do something as lame as use the issue tracker but i semi-realised i was doing this anyway by just making text documents and hand written lists of **shit i need to fix**

im glad i started tracking it this way as its actually made sitting down and finding something to do way easier, i can just have a look at the backlog and start working on one bug or feature, its been super helpful

## learnings so far

Ive become more comfortable with the tailwindcss library and basic Next / Typescript functions

some general layout changes, adding missing class' and improving my workflow for developing responsive layouts

i figured out (probably because my firewall is down) that getting the ip from my dev machine using `ipconfig` and connecting to the configured `npm run dev` port i can have the site open on my phone, make changes in vsc and see the updates in real time from hot reload
