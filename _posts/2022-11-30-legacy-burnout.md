there was a post on `r/cscareer` questions about career burnout as a developer

somebody said the only time they ever felt burnout was when they weren't building anything new and they were stuck fixing issues and maintaing old legacy systems

sounds very familiar

at my old place maybe 20% of my time was building something new, the rest was fixing issues and maintaining their pre-existing systems

at the moment i've ended up in the same position, making tweaks to the legacy system that they refused to sunset

i can see why so many people were upset with the town hall decision and left

bit annoying
