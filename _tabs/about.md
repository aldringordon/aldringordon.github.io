G'day there! I'm a Software Engineer based in Perth, Western Australia currently working at Bankwest.

I primarily focus on back-end development in Java, but I also have experience in Mobile App Development, Robotics, and Control Systems Automation.

If you can't find me sitting in front of my computer, ill either be out skating at the skatepark, snowboarding in another country somewhere, or going for a ride along the coast.
